## BoxDocker: An Autonomous Debris Removal System

### Project Summary
The BoxDocker is an autonomous spacecraft designed to combat the growing problem of space debris in Low Earth Orbit. The system is a versatile, single solution that uses a YOLOv11 deep learning model for real-time vision and a closed-loop control algorithm for precise navigation and evasion.

### Technical Approach
Developed within the NVIDIA Isaac Sim simulation environment, the BoxDocker is a multi-modal spacecraft with specialized capture mechanisms. These include a prismatic docker for large debris, deployable doors for mid-sized objects, and aerogel flaps for mcroscopic flecks. This simulation-first approach allowed us to rigorously test the system's ability to autonomously detect, evade, and capture a wide range of debris.

### Key Findings
Our simulation results validate the technical feasibility of the BoxDocker. The YOLOv11 model achieved over 97% detection accuracy, while the control system maintained a debris evasion rate of over 98%. The capture mechanisms also demonstrated high success rates on their respective target types. These findings confirm that a single, scalable robotic solution for space debris removal is a viable concept.
